# Summary

An award-winning Doctorate with over 10 years of experience of successfully developing and managing a statistical and data tools across a range of industries to meet deliver exceptional business value. I have extensive experience the in full data life cycle from data governance, requirements gathering, prototyping, implementation of a range of data tools to developing communication and maintenance strategies to maximize adoption and scalability of solutions.\

I have extensive experience in working and leading multi-disciplinary teams across industries and geographical boundaries using AGILE methodologies. My applied knowledge of the full data life cycle coupled with extensive Project Management experience allow me to translate the intricacies of a business problem into a scalable technical solution for Software Developers and Data Scientists.\

Conveying complex information to a range of stakeholders using a diverse range of methods is my forte - winning awards presenting at Scientific conference to making the regional finals of a Famelab, a public engagement in Scientific Communication Competition. I'm experienced in producing data visualisations from creating dashboards to track metrics to bespoke data storytelling for social media.
