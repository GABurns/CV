# Summary

An award-winning Data Scientist with over 10 years of experience of successfully delivering projects in a diverse range of scientific industries and technologies. I have excellent communication skills with the ability to convey complex topics to a non-technical audience using a range of mediums and carry out horizon scanning and requirements gathering to inform road maps.

I am experienced in working with a range of stakeholders, from internal *ad hoc* data analysis, implementation of annual national biological data analysis pipelines to inform international policy to working with a complex code base (c. 20,000 lines) to develop new statistical features for a production grade software as a service (SAAS) clinical trial simulation platform.

As a qualified project manager (CAPM) I have carried out a range in Project Management duties throughout the project lifecycle in a range of Data Science projects including using AGILE methodologies. This includes success
