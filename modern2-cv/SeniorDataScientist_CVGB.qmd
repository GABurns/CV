# Summary

An award-winning Doctorate with over 10 years of commercial experience of successfully implementing statistical and data tools across a range of industries that deliver exceptional business value. I have extensive experience the in the full data life cycle from data governance, requirements gathering, prototyping, implementation of a range of data tools to developing communication and maintenance strategies to maximize adoption and user experience.\

I have extensive experience in working and leading multi-disciplinary teams across industries and geographical boundaries using AGILE methodologies. My applied knowledge of the full data life cycle coupled with extensive Project Management experience allows me to translate the intricacies of a business problem into a scalable technical solution.\

Conveying complex information to a range of stakeholders using a diverse range of methods is my forte - winning awards presenting at Scientific Conferences to making the regional finals of a Famelab, a public engagement in Scientific Communication Competition. I'm experienced in producing data visualisations from creating dashboards to track metrics to bespoke data storytelling for improved engagement on social media.

# Key Achievements

Some of my key achievements demonstrating sustained success across multiple industries:

```{r}
#| label: acheivement 
#| output: asis 
tibble::tribble(
  ~ what,
  ~ role,
  ~ items,
   "Developed a predictive model that is used as a national standard",
  "Data Scientist",
 "I developed a Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy calibration models to predict the nutritive quality of forage grasses using feature extraction, data pre-processing and advanced regression techniques. The resultant predictive models are the industry standard and used as commercial model for a national variety evaluation schemes to provide 10,000s of results per annum to farmers.",
 "Work Package Leader: Synergies and Future Development",
 "H2020 Project: InnoVar (21 partner 5 million funded international project)", 
 "I organised an annual Stakeholder Forum to gather requirements and feedback from a diverse range of stakeholders to steer the direction of national policies. I developed the roadmap for the implementation of drones for the collection of field plot data to be implemented across many geographical regions and political jurisdictions.",
  "Invited Speaker to a national conference in Data Science",
  "Jumping Rivers: Shiny in Production 2022",
  "Presented on how to develop production grade Shiny applications for Data Science applications. This included writing modular code, how to deploy on cloud-based computing services (AWS), how to carry out automated tested and addressing edge cases.",
"Workpackage Leader for 'Software and algorithm development' on an Innovate UK Project",
  "Expansion of a clinical trial modelling and simulation platform to optimise trial design and facilitate synthetic data generation",
 "Developed two production-grade (Shiny) applications to improve in the extraction and transformation of real world data for use Exploristics flagship simulation software. These applications has a bespoke API that securely communicated with KerusCloud using a single login and reduced transcribing of data.",
