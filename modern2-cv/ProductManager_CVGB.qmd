# Summary

An award-winning Doctorate with over 10 years of experience of successfully developing and managing a statistical and  data tools  across a range of industries to deliver exceptional business value. I have experience the in full product life cycle from requirements gathering, data governance, prototyping to gathering feedback which allow me to produce holistic solutions that transcend domain boundaries.\

I have extensive experience in working and leading multi-disciplinary teams across industries and geographical boundaries using Agile methodologies. I am experienced in using multiple research methodologies and data sources to gather quantitative an qualitative data to inform product road maps and evaluate features. Reporting to Senior Management Teams these road maps are aligned with and also drive organisational vision and strategy.\

Conveying complex information to a range of stakeholders using a diverse range of methods is my forte - winning awards presenting at Scientific conferences, to being a regional finalist of a a national Scientific Communication Competition. These communication skills enable me to collaborate with customers to translate business requirements into technical specifications for engineering teams .
